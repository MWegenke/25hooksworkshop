In this repo are two sub-folders.

WSSolution being the solution to the HooksWorkshop

StartingPoint being a rather ugly starting place that you can build on to make better. 

Remember these are two separate applications, so to start them you must 
cd into the correct folder then install and start each individually. 

Also remember to fork and clone this to your own repo so if you push changes up you are not 
messing up other students (don't be that person).
